## Testing 

### Manual Testing
The program was tested manually by going through all possible error validation messages, and all possible game results (player win, computer win, draw). See the results below:

| Test Case | Pass? | Screenshot |
|-----------|-------|------------|
|           |       |            |
|           |       |            |
|           |       |            |

### Validator Testing 


### Unfixed Bugs

- Due to limitations in Code Institute's Heroku template, which was used for deployment, this site is *not* fully responsive. This shows responsiveness during various stages of gameplay:

The terminal cannot receive input from a mobile keyboard, and does not resize based on window size. Making the application fully responsive was beyond the scope of this project.
